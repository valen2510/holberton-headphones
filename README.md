# 0x09. Implement a design from scratch

This web page was coded from scratch based on some design models given on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/gkWRcFqkwtruWZgSfnnHF0/Holberton-School---Headphone-company)

The designs were planned for Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile, so the web page was implemented with responsiveness to different device sizes.


| **Desktop (Width: 1400 px)**  | **Tablet (Width: 760 px)** | **Mobile (Width: 480 px)** |
